CHANGES IN VERSION 0.2.0

NEW FEATURES

  - Graph can now optionally have layers.

  - Added `decompose_exposure`.

  - `create_graph` nog longer had the `sorted` option. It will alway check if
    the edges are in order and if not it will sort the edges.

  - Vertex ids are stored in graph object in the `vertex_ids` attribute. These
    can be obtained using the `vertices()` function.

  - Added an `edges` function to get the edges of the graph where the 'src' 
    'dst' field are values from the original vertex ids.
